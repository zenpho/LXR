LXR PER-VOICE MIDI TABLE
LXR by Julian Schmidt (www.sonic-potions.com)

The LXR can be assigned a global channel as well as 7 'track' channels for the parts: drum 1-3, snare, cymbal, hi-hat closed, and hi-hat open. Previously, all MIDI commands had to be sent on the global channel. The updated firmware (in this 'LXR' folder) assigns MIDI commands on a per-track basis. To send a MIDI CC command to a voice, first ensure that you are sending on the MIDI channel that the voice is set to. Then, consult the table below to determine the MIDI CC parameter number you should use.

Where possible, these parameter numbers are in keeping with the General MIDI Specifications provided by the MIDI Manufacturer's Association here: http://www.midi.org/techspecs/midimessages.php

Where specific controls are not specified, parameters have been grouped together as much as possible. 

If more than one voice is assigned to the same MIDI channel, these voices will all respond to an incoming message. In the case of the hi-hat tracks, voice parameters will be updated for messages arriving on either channel, with the exception of the envelope decay, which has been assigned a different CC value so that HH open and closed can be assigned the same channel, if desired.

For parameters that are 'on/off', have menu select items, or have less than 127 values, literal CC values are used, without scaling. For example, to turn 'Velocity > Vol' on or off, a 1 or 0 should be sent. The exception to this is the Global Morph MIDI CC, which has been scaled up to range from 0 to 254 in increments of 2.
