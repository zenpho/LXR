LXR PER-VOICE MIDI TABLE
LXR by Julian Schmidt (www.sonic-potions.com)
extensions by BRENDAN CLARKE and ZENPHO

The LXR can be assigned a global channel as well as 7 distinct channels for the parts: drum 1-3, snare, cymbal, hi-hat closed, and hi-hat open. Previously, all MIDI commands had to be sent on the global channel. The updated firmware (in this 'LXR' folder) assigns MIDI commands on a per-track basis. To send a MIDI CC command to a voice, first ensure that you are sending on the MIDI channel that the voice is set to. Then, consult the table below to determine the MIDI CC parameter number you should use.

Where possible, parameter numbers are in keeping with the General MIDI Specifications provided by the MIDI Manufacturer's Association here: https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/table-1-summary-of-midi-message

If more than one part is assigned to the same MIDI channel, these will all respond to an incoming message. In the case of the hi-hat parts, parameters will update for messages on either channel. The exception being AEG decay "d" parameter which is assigned CC72 for the open hi-hat voice only and CC75 for all other voices including the closed hi-hat voice. In this way both hi-hat parts may use different trigger notes on the same channel and have unique AEG decay parameter controls.

For parameters that are 'on/off', have menu select items, or have less than 127 values, literal CC values are used, without scaling. For example, to turn 'Velocity > Vol' on or off, a 1 or 0 should be sent. The 'Velocity Dest' param can target over 127 destinations and so both CC25 and CC26 are used (with CC26 for destinations whose ids exceed 127).

Use the main LXR menu 'ch' parameter to set the GLOBAL MIDI CHANNEL.
